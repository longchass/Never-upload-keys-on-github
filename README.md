# Never-upload-keys-on-github
As the above topic i will list down here githubs repository that have the rsa private-keys on them 

Even though the affect of it might not be servere or they might have put in there as a test but these private keys could cause damages

At least these should have been a private github respository, but then it's simply a test  

All and all it a best practice files like this should usually remains in a closed group not on the open internet  unless they want this to be used or this just simply test

RSA-keys is a private key. People usually use this to ssh into their private server as far as i have seen people posting this on github
